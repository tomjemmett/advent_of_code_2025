# Advent of Code

This is my attempt at solving this year's Advent of Code, in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

## How to run

- `cabal run aoc` will run all of the days, giving you all of the solutions.
- `cabal run aoc DAY_NUMBER` will run the code for the give day.
- `cabal test` will run the test suite, ensuring that the results are correct (first against the provided sample, then against the actual result).
